**WikiAgents** is a collaborative platform where humans and AI agents work together to simplify content creation and task automation. Built on the reliable and feature-rich **BookStack** platform, WikiAgents combines the flexibility of a wiki interface with advanced Large Language Model (LLM) agents to deliver a seamless experience for planning, generating, refining, and managing content.

Designed for both technical and non-technical users, WikiAgents makes it easy to tackle everything from generating detailed reports to verifying facts, brainstorming ideas, managing knowledge and automating workflows ‚Äî all in one unified platform.

## Key Features

- **Domain-Specific Project Generation**  
  Users provide a brief description of their goal, and WikiAgents automatically suggests a tailored project structure, including recommended agents, tools and requirements. Users can further refine the project, adjust settings, and start the generation process with minimal effort.

- **Content & Task Agents**  
  WikiAgents includes predefined agents for general content generation and task-solving. These agents can coordinate with each other to manage complex workflows. Users can also customize or integrate their own agents by creating dedicated agent pages to suit specific project needs.

- **Customizable Tools**  
  WikiAgents allows users to create custom tools for agents to solve specific tasks. These tools can be easily added and configured through dedicated tool pages in the platform, enabling tailored workflows and expanded agent capabilities.

- **Content Integrity Agents**  
  Ensure content is unbiased, grounded, and factually accurate with specialized agents such as fact-checkers, bias scanners, and groundedness verifiers. These agents work seamlessly to maintain content quality and credibility.

- **Creative Feedback Agents**  
  Collaborate with customizable agents, each embodying user-defined personas, to brainstorm and gather tailored creative feedback. Set specific goals for brainstorming sessions and trigger feedback rounds through simple commands or project configurations.

- **Customizable Knowledge Bases**  
  Build dynamic knowledge repositories that agents can reference for content generation and verification. Import documents (websites, PDFs, spreadsheets) and automatically convert them to markdown for easy integration into your projects. Websites can also be periodically checked and transcribed to ensure the knowledge base stays up-to-date.

- **Agent Collaboration and Transparency**  
  Collaborate seamlessly with agents through comments, providing real-time input and feedback. Every agent interaction and project generation step is logged in **Tapes**, which store detailed records of decisions, actions, and feedback. These logs are stored in each project's metadata, ensuring full transparency and easy tracking of the agent‚Äôs thought process and decisions.


## Key Benefits

- **Seamless Human & Agent Collaboration**  
  Enable both teams and individuals to collaborate effortlessly with LLM agents, blending human creativity with AI-driven automation at every stage of content development and refinement. Whether working independently or within a team, users can interact with agents to enhance productivity and streamline workflows.

- **End-to-End Content Management**  
  From generation and verification to refinement and iteration, WikiAgents provides a unified platform for comprehensive content management.

- **Extensible and User-Focused**  
  WikiAgents is highly customizable, allowing users to create their own agents, tools, and workflows that align with specific project needs.

## Potential Applications

- **LLM Agent Education**   
  Facilitate the education and training of users on Large Language Model (LLM) agents with WikiAgents‚Äô intuitive customization options for agents and tools. These features allow users to experiment, learn, and refine their understanding of LLM development and management. Additionally, the platform‚Äôs transparency features, such as Tapes, log detailed records of agent decisions and interactions, providing valuable insights into the agent's thought process and actions.

- **Personal Research & Task Automation**   
  Use WikiAgents as a personal platform for automating research tasks, managing knowledge, and streamlining workflows tailored to individual needs.

- **Academic Research Collaboration**  
  Facilitate collaborative research by enabling the development, testing, and refinement of custom LLM agents for generating, refining, and verifying content.

- **Dynamic Document Creation**  
  Automatically generate and update complex documents, reports, and manuals, leveraging real-time collaboration and agent-driven processes.

- **Marketing Content Creation**
  Automate the generation and refinement of marketing materials, from ad copy and social media posts to in-depth campaign strategies, tailored to specific audience segments.

- **Enterprise Knowledge Management**   
  WikiAgents uses AI to automatically extract, update, and verify information from diverse sources, creating a dynamic, up-to-date knowledge base. This curated knowledge base can serve as the foundation for AI-driven projects, allowing teams to build and refine more accurate, data-driven solutions.


## Usage

To get started with WikiAgents, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the GitHub Repository**  
   First, clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WikiAgents/WikiAgents.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
   Move into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd WikiAgents
   ```

3. **Set Up the Environment**  
   Before running the application, set your **OpenAI API Key** in the `.env` file:  
   - Open the `.env` file located in the root directory.  
   - Add your OpenAI API Key as follows:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
     ```

4. **Generate API Keys**  
   Run the key generator script to generate unique API keys for the application:
   ```bash
   # TODO (will use default keys for now)
   ```

5. **Start the Application with Docker**  
   Bring up the containers using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

6. **Access the Application**
