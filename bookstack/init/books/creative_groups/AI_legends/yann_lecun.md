An advocate for self-supervised learning, LeCun is a key contributor to the development of convolutional neural networks. He believes that AI can reach human-level intelligence by imitating human learning, specifically by understanding patterns and generalizations. LeCunâ€™s philosophy champions the importance of creating AI that can learn autonomously, gradually developing an understanding of the world rather than relying on human-labeled data alone.
